// Watch ahead: an app on the live camera.
//
// With camera: 'live', the glasses stream video to the laptop while the app
// runs, and onFrame gets the newest picture about once a second. Every eight
// seconds this app asks Gemini what the main thing ahead is, in a few words,
// and says it when it changes. The button describes the view in full, at
// once: with the live camera, g.takePhoto() returns the newest picture
// without waiting for the glasses.
//
// Needs the glasses on a Wi-Fi network that reaches the laptop, and ffmpeg
// on the laptop. With the phone as the glasses, onFrame does not run, and the
// button takes a photo with the phone camera.
//
// Shows: camera: 'live', onFrame, pacing Gemini calls, g.takePhoto with the live camera
